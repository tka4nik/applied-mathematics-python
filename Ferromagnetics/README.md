# Calculating mean energy of a ferromagnetic

This project caclulates normalized mean energy value of a ferromagnetic in a 2D case. It is done by using the Ising Model of ferromagnetism (from statistical mechanics). Calculatings are optinised using Numba multithreading and by storing all possible combinations of spins as a binary number.
