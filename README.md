# Applied Mathematics in Python

This repository contains a collection of projects in applied mathematics implemented in Python. The projects cover various topics such as fractals, heat transfer and ferromagnetics simulations, and nonlinear dynamics.

## Projects

1. **Julia Set Fractal**: Given a mapping generates a corresponding Julia fractal that you can interactively explore.

2. **Heat Transfer Simulation**: Simulate heat transfer scenarios using diffusion equations.

3. **Ferromagnetics Simulation**: Calculates Mean Energy of a ferromagnetic using Ising's model
4. **Nonlinear Dynamics Graphs**:
   - Bifurcation Diagrams: Visualizes the behavior of nonlinear systems as parameters change.
   - Mapping Diagrams: Mappps the evolution of a given discrete dynamic system. 
   - Lyapunov Exponent Graphs: Analyze the stability of chaotic systems.

## About the Author

This project is the work of **Nikita Tkachenko**, a student at **Higher School of Economics** during the academic years 2023-2024.

## Installation Guide

### Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
